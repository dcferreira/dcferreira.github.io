I am a Machine Learning expert based in Vienna, Austria with a background in mathematics and working since 2016 in academia and industry.
My focus is on applying ML techniques to Natural Language Processing and/or Cybersecurity topics.

I have experience in the full lifecycle of ML, from data collection/processing/labeling all the way to deployment,
and like to work in projects where a little bit of everything is needed.
My past professional experience includes a [leading cybersecurity company](https://cyansecurity.com), the
[Technical University of Vienna](https://cn.tuwien.ac.at/), among others.

Outside of work I'm passionate about music, and in particular metal (check out [some of my work](https://mydementia.bandcamp.com/releases)), and also video-games.
