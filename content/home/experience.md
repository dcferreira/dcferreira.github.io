  I was part of the [BigDAMA project](https://bigdama.ait.ac.at/), a fundamental research project focused on big data analytics for network traffic monitoring and analysis.

  My research topics are mostly related to how to represent network traffic for detecting attacks at the
network level (i.e., which features to use). Experimented with both classical features (what have people
been using and why?), and feature learning approaches using Deep Learning techniques, and in particular
representing traffic in 2-dimensional spaces.

  I was part of the [SUMMA project](http://summa-project.eu/), a huge H2020 project.

  I specifically tackled the problem of named entity recognition in which, given a text with some entity mentions
(e.g., David and Victoria), the goal is to find the corresponding entities in Wikipedia (e.g., David Beckham and
Victoria Beckham). We used both classical methods (such as SVM) and modern Deep Learning approaches."""
