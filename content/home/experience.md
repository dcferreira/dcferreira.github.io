        I tackled a multitude of ML problems in the intersection of NLP and cybersecurity.

        I worked on topics such as website categorization (using multilingual text and images), DNS tunneling detection,
        and IoT security. Heavy emphasis on developing production-ready ML models, and following MLOps best
        practices. Using state-of-the-art Machine Learning models (e.g., Transformers).

        I was part of the [BigDAMA project](https://bigdama.ait.ac.at/), a fundamental research project focused on big data analytics for network traffic monitoring and analysis.

        My research topics are mostly related to how to represent network traffic for detecting attacks at the
        network level (i.e., which features to use). Experimented with both classical features (what have people
        been using and why?), and feature learning approaches using Deep Learning techniques, and in particular
        representing traffic in 2-dimensional spaces.

        I was part of the [SUMMA project](http://summa-project.eu/), a huge H2020 project.

        I specifically tackled the problem of named entity recognition in which, given a text with some entity mentions
        (e.g., David and Victoria), the goal is to find the corresponding entities in Wikipedia (e.g., David Beckham and
        Victoria Beckham). We used both classical methods (such as SVM) and modern Deep Learning approaches.
