A simple browser extension that hides YouTube video length for user-selected channels.
Unlike other similar browser extensions, this one also hides the video length in video thumbnails.

You can easily install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/infinity-for-youtube/dikhofideaigolhecjcmfeifbchnebeo).
