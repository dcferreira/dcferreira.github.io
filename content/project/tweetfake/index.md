This was a short project I did with a pick-up team for a weekend-long Hackathon.
The idea was to take the most liked tweets for a specific user, and use a Large Language Model to generate new tweets in this user's style.

At the moment you can try it out at https://tweetfake.dcferreira.com (need to be logged in to Twitter), although it's not clear for how long this link will stay up.
There is also a short video in [the devpost project page](https://devpost.com/software/tweet-fake).
