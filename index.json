A high number of research papers propose methods to classify traffic, detect anomalies, or identify attacks. Although the goals and methodologies are commonly similar, we lack initiatives to categorize the data, methods, and findings systematically. In this paper, we present Network Traffic Analysis Research Curation (NTARC), a data model to store key information about network traffic analysis research. We additionally use NTARC to perform a critical review of the field of research conducted in the last two decades. The collection of descriptive research summaries enables the easy retrieval of relevant information and a better reuse of past studies by the application of quantitative analysis. Among others benefits, it enables the critical review of methodologies, the detection of common flaws, the obtaining of baselines, and the consolidation of best practices. Furthermore, it provides a basis to achieve reproducibility, a key requirement that has long been undervalued in the area of traffic analysis. Thus, besides reading hard copies of papers, with NTARC, researchers can make use of a digital environment that facilitates queries and reviews over a comprehensive field corpus.","tags":[],"title":"NTARC: A Data Model for the Systematic Review of Network Traffic Analysis Research","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572390000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593534861,"objectID":"6e5c771e30d96f9439db546b44b48350","permalink":"https://dcferreira.com/project/deep_architect/","publishdate":"2019-10-30T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/deep_architect/","section":"project","summary":"DeepArchitect is a framework for automatically searching over computational graphs in arbitrary domains, designed with a focus on modularity, ease of use, reusability, and extensibility.","tags":[],"title":"DeepArchitect","type":"project"},{"authors":["Renato Negrinho","Matthew Gormley","Geoffrey J Gordon","Darshan Patil","Nghia Le","Daniel C Ferreira"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572390000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593534861,"objectID":"d69d507ca67e6094528d128ef7362fb8","permalink":"https://dcferreira.com/publication/deep_architect/","publishdate":"2019-10-30T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/deep_architect/","section":"publication","summary":"Neural architecture search methods are able to find high performance deep learning architectures with minimal effort from an expert. However, current systems focus on specific use-cases (eg convolutional image classifiers and recurrent language models), making them unsuitable for general use-cases that an expert might wish to write. Hyperparameter optimization systems are general-purpose but lack the constructs needed for easy application to architecture search. In this work, we propose a formal language for encoding search spaces over general computational graphs. The language constructs allow us to write modular, composable, and reusable search space encodings and to reason about search space design. We use our language to encode search spaces from the architecture search literature. The language allows us to decouple the implementations of the search space and the search algorithm, allowing us to expose search spaces to search algorithms through a consistent interface. Our experiments show the ease with which we can experiment with different combinations of search spaces and search algorithms without having to implement each combination from scratch. We release an implementation of our language with this paper.","tags":[],"title":"Towards modular and programmable architecture search","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Félix Iglesias","Tanja Zseby","Daniel C Ferreira","Arthur Zimek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569880800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593535627,"objectID":"92be01b4455e94c39bae18def642b089","permalink":"https://dcferreira.com/publication/mdcgen/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mdcgen/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a tool for generating multidimensional synthetic datasets for testing, evaluating, and benchmarking unsupervised classification algorithms. Our proposal fills a gap observed in previous approaches with regard to underlying distributions for the creation of multidimensional clusters. As a novelty, normal and non-normal distributions can be combined for either independently defining values feature by feature (i.e., multivariate distributions) or establishing overall intra-cluster distances. Being highly flexible, parameterizable, and randomizable, MDCGen also implements classic pursued features: (a) customization of cluster-separation, (b) overlap control, (c) addition of outliers and noise, (d) definition of correlated variables and rotations, (e) flexibility for allowing or avoiding isolation constraints per dimension, (f) creation of subspace clusters and subspace outliers, (g) importing arbitrary distributions for the value generation, and (h) dataset quality evaluations, among others. As a result, the proposed tool offers an improved range of potential datasets to perform a more comprehensive testing of clustering algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Jointly Learning to Embed and Predict with Multiple Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a well-known technique that is trained on samples (e.g. pictures of fruits) and which after training is able to generate realistic new samples.

Feature vectors used for representing traffic commonly have from tens to hundreds of dimensions and hardly tolerate visual conceptualizations. In this work we use neural networks to obtain extremely low-dimensional data representations that are meaningful from an attack-detection perspective. We focus on a simple Autoencoder architecture, as well as an extension that benefits from pre-knowledge, and evaluate their performances by comparing them with reductions based on Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Experiments are conducted with a modern Intrusion Detection dataset that collects legitimate traffic mixed with a wide variety of attack classes. Results show that feature spaces can be strongly reduced up to two dimensions with tolerable classification degradation while providing a clear visualization of the data. Visualizing traffic flows in two-dimensional spaces is extremely useful to understand what is happening in networks, also to enhance and refocus classification, trigger refined analysis, and aid the security experts’ decision-making. We  dditionally developed a tool prototype that covers such functions, therefore supporting the optimization of network traffic attack detectors in both design and application phases.","tags":[],"title":"Extreme Dimensionality Reduction for Network Attack Visualization with Autoencoders","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551913200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554670538,"objectID":"f3e2e8505a3f890c5ffe9840d37e8bb0","permalink":"https://dcferreira.com/project/tfm/","publishdate":"2019-03-07T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/tfm/","section":"project","summary":"The Traffic Flow Mapper is a prototype tool for visualizing network traffic in 2D.","tags":[],"title":"Traffic Flow Mapper","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1515279600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593535627,"objectID":"0509e52eaaf4b3b9a8948cd7fb7952f5","permalink":"https://dcferreira.com/project/mdcgenpy/","publishdate":"2018-01-07T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/mdcgenpy/","section":"project","summary":"MDCGenPy is a synthetic dataset generator made specifically for testing clustering algorithms.

There are no major guidelines or best practices for feature selection in the field. The literature is full of different proposals that ultimately depend on feature availability, types of known traffic, tool limitations, specific goals, and, fundamentally, the experts' knowledge and intuition. In this work we have revisited 71 principal publications in the field of network traffic analysis from 2005 to 2017. Relevant information has been curated according to formalized data structures and stored in JSON format, creating a database for the smart retrieval of network traffic analysis researches. Meta-analysis performed upon the explored publications disclosed a set of main features that are common in a considerable volume of works and could be used as a baseline for future research. Additionally, aiming for validation and generalization in network traffic research, the creation of such meta-analysis environments is highly valuable. It allows homogenizing and joining criteria for the design of experiments, thus avoiding getting lost or becoming irrelevant due to the high complexity and variability that network traffic analysis involves.","tags":[],"title":"A meta-analysis approach for feature selection in network traffic research","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1502056800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554670538,"objectID":"daae867e75600ed510fe2c812791d08c","permalink":"https://dcferreira.com/project/ntarc/","publishdate":"2017-08-07T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/ntarc/","section":"project","summary":"The NTARC database is a collective effort of labeling and categorizing research made in the network traffic analysis field.","tags":[],"title":"NTARC Database","type":"project"},{"authors":["Daniel C Ferreira","André FT Martins","Mariana SC Almeida"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470520800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554670538,"objectID":"27ce786a283d0a51b69801ddc9675806","permalink":"https://dcferreira.com/publication/multilingual/","publishdate":"2016-08-07T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/multilingual/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a joint formulation for learning task-specific cross-lingual word embeddings, along with classifiers for that task.
