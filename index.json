There are no major guidelines or best practices for feature selection in the field. The literature is full of different proposals that ultimately depend on feature availability, types of known traffic, tool limitations, specific goals, and, fundamentally, the experts' knowledge and intuition. In this work we have revisited 71 principal publications in the field of network traffic analysis from 2005 to 2017. Relevant information has been curated according to formalized data structures and stored in JSON format, creating a database for the smart retrieval of network traffic analysis researches. Meta-analysis performed upon the explored publications disclosed a set of main features that are common in a considerable volume of works and could be used as a baseline for future research. Additionally, aiming for validation and generalization in network traffic research, the creation of such meta-analysis environments is highly valuable. It allows homogenizing and joining criteria for the design of experiments, thus avoiding getting lost or becoming irrelevant due to the high complexity and variability that network traffic analysis involves.","tags":[],"title":"A meta-analysis approach for feature selection in network traffic research","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1502056800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554670538,"objectID":"daae867e75600ed510fe2c812791d08c","permalink":"https://dcferreira.com/project/ntarc/","publishdate":"2017-08-07T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/ntarc/","section":"project","summary":"The NTARC database is a collective effort of labeling and categorizing research made in the network traffic analysis field.","tags":[],"title":"NTARC Database","type":"project"},{"authors":["Daniel C Ferreira","André FT Martins","Mariana SC Almeida"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470520800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554670538,"objectID":"27ce786a283d0a51b69801ddc9675806","permalink":"https://dcferreira.com/publication/multilingual/","publishdate":"2016-08-07T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/multilingual/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a joint formulation for learning task-specific cross-lingual word embeddings, along with classifiers for that task. Unlike prior work, which first learns the embeddings from parallel data and then plugs them in a supervised learning problem, our approach is oneshot: a single optimization problem combines a co-regularizer for the multilingual embeddings with a task-specific loss. We present theoretical results showing the limitation of Euclidean co-regularizers to increase the embedding dimension, a limitation which does not exist for other co-regularizers (such as the l1-distance). Despite its simplicity, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on the RCV1/RCV2 dataset when transferring from English to German, with training times below 1 minute. On the TED Corpus, we obtain the highest reported scores on 10 out of 11 languages.","tags":[],"title":"Jointly Learning to Embed and Predict with Multiple Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470520800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554670538,"objectID":"c6c339612001a32c4548433aef7b3437","permalink":"https://dcferreira.com/project/multilingual_embeddings/","publishdate":"2016-08-07T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/multilingual_embeddings/","section":"project","summary":"Multilingual embeddings can be used for any Natural Language Processing task which applies to multiple languages.","tags":[],"title":"Multilingual Embeddings","type":"project"}]
