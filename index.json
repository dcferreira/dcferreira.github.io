My current research focus is on applying machine learning techniques for cyber security.\nI received a MSc in Applied Mathematics from Técnico Lisboa. I’ve worked for almost 2 years in machine learning applied to Natural Language Processing, in my MSc thesis and at Priberam. In 2016 I moved to Vienna to work in cyber security, an area by which I’ve always been fascinated. After working as a project assistant for the Communications Networks group at the Technical University of Vienna, Austria, I decided to move to the industry.\nOutside of work I’m passionate about music, and in particular metal (check out some of my work), and also video-games.\n","date":1580342400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1580342400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a machine learning expert working at Cyan Security.

Conditional GANs (CGANs) additionally provide label information for subclasses (e.g. apple, orange, pear) which enables the GAN to learn more easily and increase the quality of its output samples. We use GANs to learn architectural features of major cities and to generate images of buildings which do not exist. We show that currently available GAN and CGAN architectures are unsuited for this task and propose a custom architecture and demonstrate that our architecture has superior performance for this task and verify its capabilities with extensive experiments.\n","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"482a39f7418c7ee7470038a7fa3a498d","permalink":"https://dcferreira.com/project/city-gan/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/city-gan/","section":"project","summary":"City-GAN uses Conditional Generative Adversarial Neural Networks to generate pictures of fake buildings, with the architectural characteristics of a specific city.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"City-GAN","type":"project"},{"authors":["Daniel C.
